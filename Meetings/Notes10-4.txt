Meeting #5: Thursday, October 4

Present at the meeting were:
    - Lucy
    - Dan
    - Nick
    - Nathan

everyone was present

We had a short meeting this week
Dan and Nick looked at the Amazon Web Service (AWS) which turns out to be more complicated than what we need, and also has fees
We decided that we will probably just ping Amazon with the barcodes that we need because we are not likely to exceed the limit
Our next steps are to try to figure out the SQL Server database and whether the files we obtained from the client's computer will be usable for development
We also plan to look into what the information we get from Amazon will look like and how to use regular expressions to read the data

Nick: Set up a Microsoft Studio C# project that we can all obtain from Github
Dan: Look into the full version of SQL Server and check files from the client's computer
Nathan and Lucy: Try to ping Amazon in C# and work with running regular expressions on the results

Our next meeting will be Thursday, October 11
