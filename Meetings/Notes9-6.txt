Meeting #1: Thursday, September 6

Present at the meeting were:
    - Lucy
    - Dan
    - Nick

We discussed the planning document and in particular the components of our application: 
    - GUI
        * a screen for each feature
    - Database
        * inventory table
        * transaction table
    - Transaction logic
    - Inventory logic
    - Price comparison logic

We discussed using Visual Studio for development, and either C# or C++.
    - Nick is going to look into which language is better suited to our application, in particular interfacing with a database.
    - Dan is going to look into whether we can get a full version of Visual Studio with a Microsoft Developers account.

We decided that the next step is writing the planning document, and we split the work between the three of us at the meeting:
    1. Intro
    2. Project organization
    3. Risk analysis
    4. Hardware and software resource requirements
    5. Work breakdown
    6. Project schedule
    7. Monitoring and reporting mechanisms
    - Lucy will do sections 1, 6, and 7
    - Dan will do sections 2 and 5
    - Nick will do sections 3 and 4

We put off deciding on more solid plans for a work breakdown until we have a chance to meet as a whole group.  We also decided to wait to begin sketching the database structure and screen interfaces until we visit the store.

We plan to have regular group meetings on Thursdays at 1:30.

Next Tuesday (9-11) we will meet at the regular time outside the classroom before our group meeting with Siy.

Next Thursday (9-13) we plan to visit the store to get an idea of the current state of the business.
