Meeting #8: Thursday, October 25

Present at the meeting were:
    - Lucy
    - Dan
    - Nick
    - Nathan

This week we did midterm presentations, so our meeting was short.

We found out that the client sells used books and DVDs, and may start selling used video games.  We hope that barcodes will be sufficient for finding the correct item.

- Nathan is going to continue doing work on the web scraper.
- Lucy is going to try to set up the database that Dan got working.
- Nick is going to look at the Amazon Web Services code to see what he can figure out.
- Dan is going to do some research on Google and other possible shopping sites that could be used to obtain prices.

Next Thursday (November 1) we are doing a practice exam for the assessment, so we plan to meet for a short time before the exam (around 1:15 or so).
