Meeting #6: Thursday, October 11

Present at the meeting were:
    - Lucy
    - Dan
    - Nick
    - Nathan

Dan and Nathan found that the files copied from the database on the client's computer were not usable, so we will need to get a schema of the database and set one up manually.

Nick got a project set up and committed to Github so that we can all work on a single set of code.

Lucy learned a little about the Amazon Web Service and attempted to get some code working that would search the Amazon product database.

Our next steps will be:
Lucy: put code from attempts to use Amazon Web Service into the shared project code, and try to get a search to work
Nick: get schema for database and look at Amazon Web Service code after Lucy uploads it
Dan: try to get Visual C# to communicate with a database in Microsoft SQL Server; set up actual database when Nick gets schema
Nathan: start work on a web scraper that can be used to search Amazon if the AWS code does not pan out

Next meeting: 10/18/2012
