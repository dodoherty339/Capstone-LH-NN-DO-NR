Meeting #4: Thursday, September 27

Present at the meeting were:
    - Lucy
    - Dan
    - Nick
    - Nathan

**Note: the project has been changed to focus on the price comparison aspect of the application instead of the entire point-of-sale system.

We visited Digital Attitude this week in order to get some questions answered:

1. Database
    - What application? 
        * Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio Express
        * Decided to possibly switch to C# in order to communicate with database more easily
    - Can it be accessed from outside application? 
        * Yes
2. Amazon prices
   - How to get them? 
      * Amazon Web Services http://aws.amazon.com/

We found out that the client uses Amazon to look up prices of the used items he sells.  He usually checks the prices again if he has had an item for 2 weeks and changes the price if necessary.

We assigned tasks for the week:
    - Dan and Nick are going to do some research on the Amazon Web Services website
    - Nathan is going to look into the Microsoft SQL Server application and see what he can find out about the client's database
    - Lucy is going to update the current documentation to reflect our new plans

Our next meeting will be Thursday, October 4 at 1:30 at PKI.
