Meeting #10: Thursday, November 8

Present at the meeting were:
    - Lucy
    - Dan
    - Nick
    - Nathan

Most of the meeting time was spent trying to get the database to work on Nick's computer.  Professor Siy tried to help us figure out what the errors meant.

Nick and Nathan are going to try to get their databases working so that they, along with Dan, can start putting the entire program together.

Lucy is going to work on the final paper that has to be written for the project.
