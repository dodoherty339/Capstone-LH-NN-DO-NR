Meeting #9: Thursday, November 1

Present at the meeting were:
    - Lucy
    - Dan
    - Nick
    - Nathan

Dan discovered that Google API provides something like what we wanted for Amazon: it searches Google shops and returns records with pricing information.  He has written a small scraper program, which we will probably expand and use for our application.

Nick and Nathan were getting help from Dan to set up their databases.

Lucy is going to start working on the documentation we need to write for the end of the capstone.

Next Thursday (November 8) we will be going over our practice assessment tests, so we will probably try to meet before or after class at least for a short time.
