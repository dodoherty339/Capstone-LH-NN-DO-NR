Project Proposal

The objective of this proposal is to give an overview of our capstone project, including descriptions of our project, what we intend to accomplish, how we can accomplish this, and possible ideas for making the project work. For our project, we will be working with a client to provide them with a computer science-related solution to their problem. We will use what we already know, as well as continue to learn, to accomplish this task.

Our client will be Justin Richardson, owner of the small business, Digital Attitude. This store sells  Japanese animation collectibles, movies, books, and more. It is located within Crossroads Mall. This business has been in operation for about 6 years and it also supports a Japanese animation club at UNO called UNOtaku. Our project will be the creation of a new POS (Point-of-Sales) program that has the following objectives:
	- Handle the sales of products to consumers
	- Track the store's inventory using a database
	- Allow price comparison from Amazon.com
	- Keep information and data from sales
	- Abide by all sales laws and include tax with all sales.
	- More

In order to create this program, we will need to learn more about how Mr. Richardson runs his business so that we can tailor this program to suit his needs. Based on what he has told us already, most, if not all, of his inventory has a barcode that must be scanned. The scanner is a simple device that reads the UPC number, automatically types it in the currently selected field, and sends the computer the “return” command. This will be used to automatically read the product information from the database whenever it is scanned into the program. Our main screen will need to enable simple functionality to edit items for the product currently scanned, such as quantity, price, and so on. The screen will also need to display a subtotal of all currently scanned products, and include sales tax on all taxable products (the store sells several snacks and drinks that are not to be taxed). When the customer is ready to pay, we will need to indicate their method of paying. It is understood that credit card machines/devices do all the work for calling in the credit card to see if it's valid, but it's not clear what information these devices send back to the computer. As well, we will need to learn exactly how to create a summary of the transaction that can be printed as a receipt. After the transaction has been completed, the database should reflect the number of products sold and the software should create a record of the transaction that just took place. It would be a nice feature to allow a summary of all the sales to be printed out at the end of the day for record keeping. Also, the program will need to keep track of the net profit made from each sale, which means that the cost of goods will need to be recorded in the system whenever inventory is obtained. Our program will need to allow this data to be recorded with ease to decrease the time spent inputting data.

The inventory will be kept in a database. Our group will need to discuss with each other in more detail how we plan to implement this database. We will need to make sure that the database is always kept up-to-date to ensure that there are no errors or confusion when it comes to reordering products or finding the product in the store. The inventory database is a very important tool, and we will work to ensure it stays accurate.

Along with the sales and inventory holding, our program will need to include functionality for price comparisons. Mr. Richardson would like to be able to automatically pull prices from Amazon.com, as this site is most likely one of the only commonly known sites that has most of the same products as those that are sold in his store. With that information, data mining would be the best option to pull prices that can be compared or referenced. However, depending on the size of the inventory to be compared, it would not be suggested to send so many requests at Amazon all at once. Mr. Richardson has informed us that Amazon provides a printable file of their products and prices that can be referenced and searched to find the products we need and their prices. This is something that will need further research.

Since we will be designing a program meant for sales, we must make sure that every calculation is correct when it comes to sales tax and that all transactions are done legally. If we don't take the utmost care and concern with this project, we may end up creating a program that breaks the law. We will take that into careful thought throughout the entire project. We want this project to be done correctly.

The objectives and plans described above are just the beginning of what we hope to accomplish. These are tentative to what we want, and some details may change depending on how to project process goes. More details and objectives may be added as we spend more time working together.
