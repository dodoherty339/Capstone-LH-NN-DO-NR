Project Planning document

Introduction
    This document will set out a tentative plan for the development of a price comparison application. We will discuss the components needed for the application, some of the risks that we need to be aware of when developing the application, the hardware and software required for the finished product, a breakdown of the work that will be done by each member of the team, a tentative schedule for the iterations of the project, and information about our project tracking system.
    
================================================
Project Organization
    Our project will be to design a standalone application.  It will need to communicate with separate applications.
	
    The application will need to read from and write to a database; it will also need to request and receive information from Amazon.com.
	
    The main work of the application will be done within its logic.  The information read from the database will be processed in order to put it in a request that will be sent to Amazon.com.  Then the information received from Amazon.com will need to be processed in some way and then the database may or may not be modified.
    
================================================
Risk Analysis
    Our application should not have many risks involved with it.  It will not be handling transactions of any kind, so concerns about tax and other retail issues will not be a factor.  Since we will be attempting to get a lot of information from Amazon.com, we will have to be careful about how we get it so that we are not seen as trying to perpetrate a denial-of-service attack.

================================================
Hardware and Software Resource Requirements
    Our application will only require the following resources
        - A PC running the point-of-sale software and containing the inventory database
        - An internet connection/connection to Amazon.com

================================================
Work Breakdown
    We have tentatively discussed assigning Lucy to be the designated GUI designer and scribe during meetings. Nick will be team leader.  As far as the logic goes, Nathan has started researching the database, while Nick and Dan are researching the Amazon.com side.  Those may be the portion of the logic that they each focus on once we get to coding.

================================================
Project Schedule 
    As our project has not been fully mapped out yet, our schedule will be very tentative.
	
    Our application will need to interact with a database and with some sort of API belonging to Amazon.  These two things can be programmed independently, and then the two functionalities can be bridged with the logic that will process the information.

    This is still a very tentative schedule, and the following dates are subject to changes due to unexpected difficulties or changes in the client’s needs:

              Deliverables                                          Date
        | 1 | Updated documentation, research                     | Week of October 4   |
        | 2 | Database interaction: read from database            | Week of October 18  |
        | 3 | Database interaction: write to database             | Week of November 1  |
        | 4 | Amazon.com interaction: request and receive prices  | Week of November 15 |
        | 5 | Process data between database and Amazon.com        | Week of November 29 |
        | 6 | Completed application, final documentation          | Week of December 10 |

    Testing for functionality and usability will be conducted throughout the development process.

================================================
Monitoring and Reporting Mechanisms
    For our project tracking system we are using GitHub.  We have set up a repository which is at https://github.com/lucyh/Capstone-LH-NN-DO-NR.  We will keep track of all code changes made by each member of the group, as well as sharing copies of all documentation required for the project and notes from our team meetings.  Everyone will have a GitHub account in order to have access to all of the files in the repository.
